Project motivation : 

The main emotion of the game is (FEAR)

a lot of people enjoy horror movies and games and the suspense that comes along with them and how exciting it can be to play them, what makes this experience even better is thinking of questions to escape. 


Project main ideas : 

* A user is trapped into an abandoned hospital DONE

* The answer for each question can be found in the room the user has just to think and look into the right places (DONE)

* create a plot twist for the game (Removed from the scope)

* if the user fails to answer any question he'll be killed and lose the game (DONE)

* In the final room if the user solves the question he'll be able to escape DONE

* make different storylines for the game where user can choose easy and hard moods (hard has more rooms with harder questions) (removed from the scope)

* make the game limited with time solve questions (removed from the scope)

Fundamentals : 

1. Scale achievement (100 points)

as the main environment for the game is a hospital so scale was implemented to ensure that users feel that their height is normal in the environment 

2. Animation achievement (100 points)

Different animations were used in the game to bring it to life such as 

1. Room doors when clicked they animate along with a door squack sound to make it more realistic 

2. Some hints in rooms when clicked are animated to be closer to the user such as the photo frame in the first room when clicked it's animated. 

3. Lighting achievement (100 points)

Both baked and realtime lighting are used ensuring running 60 fps on android mobiles 

4. Locomotion achievement (100 points)

5. Video Player achievement (100 points)

A video player in the last room is used to play a video of a song that's used as a hint for the last room 

Completeness: 


1. Gamification achievement (250 points) : 

this's the core feature of the game as  the experience is focused to drive users to think and explore the game so they can be rewarded with the escape of the scary place as nothing but their brains and observations will save them  

2. Diegetic UI achievement (250 points) :

Making the game as realistic as possible was one of the main challenges while developing the game, so instead of making texts floating in the space I.e room questions, options, game over message...  were written as a message appearing on a tv in each room to make it as something a real character in real life would see 

3. 3D Modeling achievement (250 points) : 

It's always fun to learn something new, a 3d model of a cup was created using blender the model can be found in the first room
